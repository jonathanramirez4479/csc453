Answers:

1. When workloads arrive with incrementally increasing burst sizes, then no job would be preempted,
therefore scheduling jobs like the FIFO algorithm.

2. If we have a quantum length greater than or equal to the largest job's burst time, then RR will have similar response times
 to SRTN having jobs with similar burst sizes.

3. As job lengths increase, the response time increases.  This was shown through the simulator as turnaround time and
 wait time would increase.  This makes sense because jobs would take longer to finish.

Job 0 -- Turnaround 1 Wait  0
Job 1 -- Turnaround 2 Wait  0
Job 2 -- Turnaround 4 Wait  1
Job 3 -- Turnaround 7 Wait  3
Job 4 -- Turnaround 11 Wait  6
Average --  Turnaround 5.0  Wait 2.0


Job 0 -- Turnaround 2 Wait  0
Job 1 -- Turnaround 4 Wait  0
Job 2 -- Turnaround 8 Wait  2
Job 3 -- Turnaround 14 Wait  6
Job 4 -- Turnaround 22 Wait  12
Average --  Turnaround 10.0  Wait 4.0

4. As quantum lengths increase, so does response time.  
R = (N - 1) * q
N = number of jobs
q = quantum length 

N - 1 signifies the first process to run has a response time of 0.
