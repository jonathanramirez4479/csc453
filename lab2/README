Answers:

1. When workloads arrive with incrementally increasing burst sizes, then no job would be preempted,
therefore scheduling jobs like the FIFO algorithm.

2. If we have a quantum length greater than or equal to the jobs' burst times, then RR will have similar response times
 to SRTN having jobs with similar burst sizes.
