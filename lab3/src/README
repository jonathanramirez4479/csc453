USAGE: ./memSim <reference-sequence-file.txt> <FRAMES> <PRA>

BACKING STORE INSTRUCTIONS: String filePath = "./src/BACKING_STORE.bin";

WORKING: Implementation without any modifications from the book. (i.e. hard-coded 256 frames, and no replacement algorithm): 10 points
         Support for a variable number of frames and FIFO page replacement algorithm: 4 points
         Support for true LRU page replacement algorithms: 4 points
         Support for OPT algorithm

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    You may have to add all source code into a folder "src" due to our IntelliJ setup that only allowed us to
    execute the simulator outside of src.  Please refer to the shell script.
