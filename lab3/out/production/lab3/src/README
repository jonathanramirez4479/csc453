USAGE: memSim <reference-sequence-file.txt> <FRAMES> <PRA>

WORKING: Implementation without any modifications from the book. (i.e. hard-coded 256 frames, and no replacement algorithm): 10 points
         Support for a variable number of frames and FIFO page replacement algorithm: 4 points
         Support for true LRU page replacement algorithms: 4 points

NOT WORKING: Support for OPT (optimal) page replacement algorithm: 2 points
