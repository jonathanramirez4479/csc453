TinyFS implementation: Our TinyFS has all required core functions.  We were able to implement all additional functions from areas A and B.  The tfs_displayFragments() function simply shows the bitmap vector in big endian form to demonstrate the blocks in the disk.  The tfs_defrag manages to move all free blocks to the end of the disk in contiguous form.  Our tfs_rename() function renames a file by first renaming it in our root directory inode structure which is then written to file after unmounting the disk.  tfs_readdir() simply prints all the files in our disk, however, it being a flat file system, it only prints file names.

As of now, there are no known bugs in our system.  Our only limitations are the fact that we have a flat file system and can't create new directories, and we only have a readByte rather than having a mechanism for reading more than one byte to a buffer.

NOTE: TO RUN THIS FILE YOU MUST USE THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF PYTHON... AND POSSIBLY PYCHARM. We are using typing in our modules, and unfortunately, the unix servers are very outdated.  Sorry.
